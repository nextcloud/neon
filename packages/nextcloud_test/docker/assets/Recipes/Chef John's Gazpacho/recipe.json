            "reviewBody": "Oh Chef John, your reputation precedes you! From your how-to videos to your numerous published recipes, you've earned your title. I was craving Summer and happened to find this recipe, and while I don't have end of season tomatoes yet, this gazpacho turned out incredibly. If you love to cook, but take satisfaction in the preparation of the dish, then try this recipe. I had some time on a Saturday afternoon all to myself to create, and chopping the vegetables was a great source of relaxation. I felt like a character in a movie (have you ever seen Julia & Julia?) while I was preparing this soup. OK, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but the finished product is DELICIOUS! Don't be intimidated by the steps, and here is a great tip from the video--to peel tomatoes easily, dip them in a pot of boiling water for a few seconds. You'll be able to pull the peel off easily before dicing them. THANKS for a wonderful, fresh, healthy recipe! I can't wait to share this with my friends.",

I made this over the weekend and I am now making it again for an end of school party on Friday for the teachers. I didn't change a single thing in this recipe. This is an absolute MUST try recipe. On a side ntoe - I served this for dinner, but I also served it for brunch along with a southwestern breakfast casserole and it worked very well together.

You can teach an old dog new tricks or new recipes anyway.;) I made no changes to it and my family and friends loved it! Gazpacho can be time consuming to make but John's isn't but 45 minutes and viewing his video to make it makes it all the more easy. Plus his voice is so relaxing to me!;) The only thing I added was a cucumber slice and a dollop of Daisy Sour Cream to the top of each serving. Bon appetit!",

I'd all but given up but this recipe showed up in my inbox and I thought \"what the heck we'll try one more gazpacho recipe.\" SO THANKFUL I DID!!! and I'm sorry to say I did change one thing. I did not see the 4 tomatoes called for first thing. so I got home and had all the rest of the ingredients but not those. So-what to do??? I followed the rest of the directions and then added 2 cups of low-sodium V8. This soup is amazing. I'm letting it chill now as I write but it already tastes so good I know this is going to be a once-a-weeker for the rest of the summer! and I am doing great things for my body!!! also I didn't strain the blenderized cherry tomatoes. and I used 1\/4 of a yellow onion and blenderized that with the cherry tomatoes. I'm coming in with a spoon boys and y'all better get out of the way!!!!",

Also left out the lime as our tomatoes were bright enough without. My son didn't care for the raw onion and my husband and I decided I should dice the onion a lot smaller next time (I used my vitamix to chop the veg). I was however very pleased with the flavor. I think I might go heavier on the cumin and oregano next time just to play up the Spanish influence. I made some biscuits to go with (didn't have time to make bread) and that was dinner. It was delicious. Our cherry tomatoes are candy-sweet and the big yellow tomatoes were very mild and relatively low acid. So this ended up on the sweet end of the spectrum which really suited me very well. I think it will be even better tomorrow.",
