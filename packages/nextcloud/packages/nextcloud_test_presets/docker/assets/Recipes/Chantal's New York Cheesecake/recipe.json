A couple of things you should know about cheesecakes:\n\nOVERBEATING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO CRACK. Beat cream cheese with sugar only until smooth. Proceed with a wooden spoon for the rest of the recipe.\n\nOVERBEATING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO HAVE THE \"WRONG\" TEXTURE. Air bubbles, gritty\/not creamy texture, etc., are fixed my the same instructions above.\n\nOVERCOOKING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO CRACK. Do NOT cook this cheesecake until it's set. Matter of fact, don't check it at all. Put the cheesecake in the oven, set the timer to 60 min., turn the oven off, and forget it. I mean it! Don't open the oven, just leave it alone to do its thing.\n\nAnd that's it. A beautiful cheesecake. Far from bland: this is a PURIST'S cheesecake. It's great as is, but also a great foil for other flavours. I serve mine with passionfruit pulp or mango puree.",

I have made this cheesecake many times; sometimes it cracks sometimes it doesn't. Finally I read that if you grease the sides of your pan, it will not crack, since cracking often happens in the cooling process as the cake pulls away from the sides.

With the tips that I picked up on allrecipes.com, Chantal's New York Cheesecake was a hit with my family & friends. After cooling, the top remained level and the center firmed up. The top was a beautiful golden brown with no dry edges. The inside was creamy and smooth, and not too sweet.\r\n\r\nThe tips are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that your ingredients are around room temperature, not cold, otherwise your batter will be lumpy.\r\n\r\n2. Wrap your springform pan with 2 layers of aluminum foil to prevent water in the bain marie (water bath) from seeping in.\r\n\r\n3. Place your springform pan in a water bath in the oven, filled with 1 inch of very hot water, then proceed to bake as instructed in the recipe.\r\n\r\n4. Right after baking, run a warm or greased knife around the rim of the cake to prevent cracking while cooling.\r\n\r\n5. Leave the cake in the oven for 2 hours to cool. (I didn't have time to leave it in for the recommended 6 hrs, and it still works.)\r\n\r\nI'll make variations of this cheesecake, such as blueberry topping, oreo base and filling etc.\r\n\r\nENJOY!",

            "reviewBody": "AMAZING! The KING of all cheesecakes! This is the recipe you are looking for, Thick and Creamy! Ive made this 2X now with tremendous sucess. However, I found this crust to need some work, so this is the recipe I use: 1 1 \/2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1\/2 c. white sugar, 1\/4 c. finely chopped Unsalted nuts (walnuts, pecans), 1\/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1\/4 tsp. nutmeg. Mix together and press into 9\" springform pan. As for the cheesecake mixture, make Sure to start with room temp. ingredients, use a mixer to beat cream cheese and sugar, then hand-mix from there on. Feel free to add chocolate chips, toffee bits, etc. to the mixture before transferring into graham cracker crust. Use a water bath, (See Cheesecake section under Cooking Basics on this site) with the pan double wrapped in foil. When cheesecake is done, turn oven off, run knife around edge of the cake to completely loosen from the pan. Close oven door, leave in for 3+ hours, until completely cool. Refrigerate overnight. I make a homemade raspberry topping, as follows: 1 10oz. pkg frozen raspb., 2 tblsp. white sugar, 2 tsp. cornstarch & 1\/2 c. water. In med. saucepan, mix sugar & corn starch well. Add water & bring to a boil. Add raspberries & boil for 5 minutes, or until thick. If you wish, strain the hot mixture to remove seeds. Place in refrigerator to completely cool. Place 1-2 tablespoons over chilled cheesecake, top with a curl of white chocolate. Award Winning!",

            "reviewBody": "I have been working with this recipe for a couple of years now. Yesterday, one of my co-workers and I had a cheesecake cook-off. Everyone RAVED about my cheesecake and I felt bad for the other guy. His was made with Cool-Whip and took 20-30 minutes to make. Mine was Chantal's (with modifications) and took me 16 hours from start to serve (including chilling).\n\nI have been adjusting this recipe to get the perfect weight, density, and creaminess (to MY tastes) and I THINK I've got it! (By George, I think she's got it!) I like a HEAVY New York-Style Cheesecake that's not TOO cakey (translation: DRY!). So here is what I've come up with:\n\nI use 2 TBSP. flour instead of 1\/4 cup AND use a water bath.\nI baked it at 225 degrees for 3 hours and 40 minutes (I KNOW that sounds like a LONG time, but remember, I've been working on this for a couple of years - OK.......not consistantly, but whenever I feel like making a cheesecake. I make myself notes on the back of the recipe.) After it has baked 3 hours and 40 minutes, I turn off the oven and crack the oven door for a few minutes to get it to cool down more quickly. I leave the cheesecake in the oven for 6 hours and then put it in the refrigerator until WELL chilled (about 6 more hours).\n\n(More on next post)\n",

Mine didn't crack, but I was careful not to overmix and had the cream cheese at room temperature, and these are supposed to help prevent cracking. I also used a water bath, and I made sure that the side of the springform pan, not just the bottom, was well greased. (I read in a magazine that cheesecakes shrink from the sides of the pan as they cool, and if the side isn't well greased, the cheesecake will stick and, thus, crack.) Per previous reviewers, I baked it at 325 deg. and made the crust as follows: 1 1\/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1\/4 cup melted butter, 1\/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1\/4 cup sugar. I substituted Bailey's Irish Cream for the milk. I had a can of cherry pie filling available for those who wanted a topping. A picture-perfect cheesecake!",

I bake mine in a water bath, and that helps to keep it more moist, and also to avoid cracking. Make sure you put it into boiling water instead of cold. Also, put your cheesecake in an oven bag before you put it into the water bath. Wrapping the pan in tin \r\nfoil just doesn't seem to keep the water away from the crust. I also don't even add the flour. It allows the cake to be less like cake, and it makes it so creamy and rich. I also double the butter in the crust, and I add the whites of one egg. This allows it to hold together better, so it's a lot less crumbly. Lastly, I don't let mine sit in the oven for 5 to 6 hours, who has the time? I put mine straight into the fridge. It seems to turn out just as well. Good luck! :)",

I didn't have a pan big enough to put my 9-inch springform pan in for a water bath, so I just put it on a rack and put a pan of water underneath it. It was steamy enough to produce a perfectly uncracked cake (325F for 1 hr). At end of baking, unlike what it says in the cheesecake tips in the reference section, cake was completely SOLID, WITHOUT a \"3-inch circle\" that was still un-set. Cake texture still turned out PERFECT, so don't worry if there isn't a wobbly center after baking.\r\n\r\nI used \"Baker's Secret Pie Crust\" (bake crust for 15 mins, not 10) instead of the grahan cracker crust, and made a sour cream topping for a professional touch (1 cup sour cream, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Combine and spread evenly after cheesecake has baked and cooled for 10 mins. Bake at 325F for 10 mins to set. Spread EVENLY, as the sour cream will not melt; it will only set, so any imperfection before you put it in the oven will show after baking. Leave in oven to cool for 6 hrs. chill and serve!). \r\n\r\n\r\nYou might want to decrease the amount of milk to 1\/2 cup for a denser cake, although do so with caution. My version as outlined above makes a 5lb cheesecake, which is about 1 1\/2 inches high using a 9-inch springform pan. Everyone who tasted my cheesecake said it was as good as the famed cheesecake of a local 5-star hotel, whose cheesecake is widely regarded as the best cheesecake in the city!

I was puzzled by the use of milk with the sour cream. I was also curious about the amount of flour, and extra 1\/2 cup sugar. Now I'm no stranger to cheesecake. I used to own a bakery up in Washington and I made close to 20 different varieties of cheesecake, most of which were customer requests and were sold by the whole cake. Enough of me. I was diligent in following this recipe as directed and it \"fell flat\". Here's why: The heat is too high (burns cake), the milk creates too much moisture and it takes too long to cook, too much flour made it too dry, and I don't know if it was the flour, or the extra 1\/2 cup sugar, or the milk but it was hard to get the flavor and texture of the cream cheese to jump out at you. I think the people that are giving this recipe five stars really need to try some other cheesecake recipes and then rate this one. Okay, thanks but \"no thanks\".",
